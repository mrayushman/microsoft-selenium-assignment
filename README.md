Technical Assessment

1. Identify any website that regularly posts publicly accessible PDF files. Examples may include some government website that posts PDFs of notices and circulars, court websites that posts PDFs of judgements, arXiv or journal websites that posts PDFs of research papers, financial regulator website that posts PDFs of corporate filings, or any other website that regularly posts PDF files. <br> <br>

2. Use Selenium IDE to record a test automation to download the latest PDF posted on your chosen website. Your script must download the latest PDF posted when the script is run, and not hardcode the file to download. You can install Selenium IDE from here: https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/.  <br><br>

3. Use selenium side runner to execute your SIDE file via the command line and verify that your automation works as expected. You can install Selenium side runner from here: https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/command-line-runner/    <br><br>

4. Export the generated .side file from the previous step and check-in to your GitHub repository under any permissive open-source license (e.g. MIT License, CC-BY) so we are able to access it, execute it, and assess it
